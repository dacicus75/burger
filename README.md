# burger

Created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and ORM.

I also deployed my app to Heroku for web hosting. 

I followed the MVC design pattern, used Node and MySQL to query and route data, and I used Handlebars to generate HTML.

BurgerApp is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they’d like to eat. 

Whenever a user submits a burger’s name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page — waiting to be devoured. 

Each burger in the waiting area will have a ‘Devour it!’ button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right of the page. 

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
